    "The data points of the cumulative evolution over time are shown with black + signs. The data was extracted from the online cataloge of the Robert-Koch-Institute at https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0?orderBy=IdLandkreis&orderByAsc=false&where=Bundesland%20%3D%20%27Bayern%27 .\n",

    "Once eight data points are available a non-linear least square fit is performed for a specific date. For the following dates also a similiar fit is performed also using the eight most recent available datapoints. In this case the fit is weighted towards the most recent development and is not contaminated by the early evolution with is currently of secondary interest. Fits of early dates are dark blue. Most recent fits are yellow. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the fit the routine ``curve_fit`` of the ``scipy.optimize`` module was used with respect to the following theoretical function ``y = a * exp(b * x)``. For further information see: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html\n",

    "It is possible to display the approximated demand of intensive care facilities as a function of time. This a very rough approximation currently using 5% of the currently approximated cases. This number can be changed. We would appreciate input of which number best to used. If the Hospital Capacity of the specific county is available the corresponding availability can be colorcoded in a traffic light manner. \n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the semi logarithmic plot and the evolution of the doubeling time that some counties have slowed down their exponential growth of the case numbers. However some are still on doubling times smaller than 4 days (e. g. LK Dillingen, LK Guenzburg, LK Neustadt a. d. Waldnaab, SK Ingolstadt, SK Schweinfurt). For some of the counties a turn over in the case number evolution is not yet visible (e. g. LK Dillingen, LK Amberg-Sulzbach, LK Bad Kissingen, LK Cham).\n",
    "\n",
    "How ever I need to emphasize that even though an improve in the doubeling times and a turn over in case numbers in the logarithmic plot is visible (e. g. LK Miesbach), still the capazities of the local hospital facilities are limited. \n",
