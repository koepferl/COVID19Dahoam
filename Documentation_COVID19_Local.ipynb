Most recent fits are yellow. \n",

LK Bad Kissingen, LK Guenzburg, LK Neustadt a.d.Waldnaab, LK Straubing-Bogen, SK Amberg, SK Hof, SK Ingolstadt, SK Kaufbeuren, SK Schweinfurt). For some of the counties a turn over in the case number evolution is not yet visible (e. g. LK Dillingen, LK Amberg-Sulzbach, LK Bad Kissingen).\n",
