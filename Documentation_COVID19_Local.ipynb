    "\n",
    "### Dataset downloaded 2020-04-02\n",
    "We can see from the semi logarithmic plot and the evolution of the doubling time that some counties have slowed down their exponential growth of the case numbers. However some are still on doubling times smaller than 5 days (e. g. LK Bad Kissingen, LK Guenzburg, LK Neustadt a.d.Waldnaab, LK Straubing-Bogen, SK Amberg, SK Hof, SK Ingolstadt, SK Kaufbeuren, SK Schweinfurt). For some of the counties a turn over in the case number evolution is not yet visible (e. g. LK Dillingen, LK Amberg-Sulzbach, LK Bad Kissingen).\n",
    "\n",
    "However I need to emphasize that even though an improve in the doubling times and a turn over in case numbers in the logarithmic plot is visible (e. g. LK Miesbach), still the capacities of the local hospital facilities are limited. \n",

Unfortunately some counties are lacking behind in their data transmission, or correcting some numbers afterwards, this is why there might be still some fluctuation (see above).\n",
